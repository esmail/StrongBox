# Tested on StarCluster 0.95.5
# To create a cluster for testing StrongBox, run the command:
#starcluster -c strongbox_starcluster_config start strongbox_cluster

# Once you're finished testing, you can shut down the cluster with the command:
#starcluster terminate strongbox_cluster

# Lastly, to verify that you won't be charged by Amazon for keeping any idle clusters up, list your running clusters with the command:
#starcluster listclusters
